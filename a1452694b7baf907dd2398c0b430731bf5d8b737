I think mmap or a key-value store would\u0027ve been simpler, but the solution is appropriate.\n\nWe may reuse the Fingerprinter object for the index fingerprint as well - no need to duplicate that code.\n\nI like your use of Lambda expressions! I use them rarely, but I always like it, when I see them. ;-)\n\nYour comment regarding org.apache.lucene.util.BitDocIdSet.Builder is probably exactly what we should try. I don\u0027t know, why we didn\u0027t try that back then. Or did we try and fail? We should definitely try to adopt this and see if it speeds up the VC building.",
