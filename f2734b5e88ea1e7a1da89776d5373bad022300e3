      "message": "I think the best solution would be not using the input (ref) from user to create directories. It should be rewritten e.g. to hashcode. It\u0027s just not human-friendly, so we cannot simply delete a specific VC cache, but is it even necessary? \n\nI think we can still create a folder for username for organizing his/her VC. There shouldn\u0027t be a problem with auto-caching if the named-VC are all system VC.",

Keep using user handles for folder names is probably a good idea, just to make it more transparent and easy to modify/archive them.\n\nI think it\u0027s best to treat the parameter not as a path but as a slash delimited parameter.",
