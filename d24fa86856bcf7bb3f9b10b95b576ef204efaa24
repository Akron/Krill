      "message": "Wouldn\u0027t it be preferable to use base64url instead of base64 then? I don\u0027t mind if it invalidates the index fingerprint. And I guess this commit is a good playce to discuss that. I add Marc as a reviewer.\n\nFor explanation: This change would alter index fingerprints, meaning calculations by clients would become invalid, although the index itself wouldn\u0027t change. Is that problematic?",
