A Corpusdata Retrieval Index using Lucene for Look-Ups


## Description

Krill is a [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) based search
engine for large annotated corpora,
used as a backend component of the [KorAP Corpus Analysis Platform](http://korap.ids-mannheim.de/) at the [IDS Mannheim](http://ids-mannheim.de/).

**! This software is in its early stages and not stable yet! Use it on your own risk!**

## Features

Krill is the reference implementation for
[KoralQuery](https://korap.github.io/Koral), covering
most of the protocols features, including ...

- **Fulltext search**<br>
  *"Find all occurrences of the phrase 'sea monster'!"*<br>
  *"Find all case-insensitive words matching the regular expression /krak.*/!"*

- **Token-based annotation search**<br>
  *"Find all plural nouns in accusative!"*

- **Span-based annotation search**<br>
  *"Find all nominal phrases!"*

- **Distance search**<br>
  *"Find a verb that is in a distance of five words to the noun 'Squid'!"*

- **Positional search**<br>
  *"Find a noun at the end of a nominal phrase!"*

- **Nested queries**<br>
  *"Find a determiner at the beginning of a named entity, that occurs at the end of a sentence!"*

- **and many more ...**<br>
  Multiple annotation resources;
  Virtual Collections;
  Partial highlightings;
  Support for overlapping spans;
  Relational queries;
  Hierarchical queries ...

## Prerequisites

Java 7 or 8 SDK,
[Git](http://git-scm.com/),
[Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/).
Further dependencies are resolved using Maven.


## Setup

To install the latest version of Krill from scratch, do ...

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KorAP/Krill
$ cd Krill
```

Then run the test suite ...

```
$ mvn clean test
```

To build a Krill library and install it in your local Maven repository
(needed for Kustvakt) ...

```
$ mvn install
```

To update an existing repository, change into the Krill directory,
and pull the latest version ...

```
$ git pull origin master
```

Afterwards, rerun the test suite and install the library.

## Caveats

Krill operates on tokens and is limited to a single tokenization stream.
Token annotations therefore have to rely on that tokenization,
span annotations have to wrap at least one token.
Punctuations are currently not supported.
The order of results is currently bound to the order of documents in the
index, but this is likely to change.
