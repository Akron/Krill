      "message": "Just to understand this: If a requested VC is not found, it tests, if the VC is stored in the class path ... but - doesn\u0027t that mean users of the life system can try to load jsonlds from the testsuite? I guess, because the collections are always protected by the query rewrite, this can\u0027t result in a data breach - but wouldn\u0027t it be better to restrict this conditional path to tests only?",

      "message": "User has to specify the VC location in the Krill properties, like this: \n\nkrill.namedVC \u003d /queries/collections/named-vcs/\n\nso unless the actual VC are located in the same path, the location wouldn\u0027t be found in the classpath.\n\nBesides, in Kustvakt, it only has a few test VC defnitions in KoralQuery using Goethe textSigle, so I think it is not dangerous.\n\nBut the idea to restrict it to test only is great. Can we make a new properties like \"krill.test\u003dtrue\" or do you have any other idea?",
